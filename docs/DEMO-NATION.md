# Demo nation — build plan (`demo.fnhub.app`)

A permanently-live, self-contained instance of the platform running a **fictional
nation**, used for sales demos, screenshots, and marketing video. It is a real
nation on the real platform — its own Supabase project, its own subdomain, its
own data — so what a prospect sees is exactly what they would buy, not a mockup.

**Status:** planned. Nothing built yet.

---

## 1. Decisions (locked)

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Hosting | **Real Supabase project** (`fnhub-demo`), database-per-nation like every customer |
| URL | `demo.fnhub.app` — covered by the existing `*.fnhub.app` wildcard cert |
| Access | **Private — sales team only.** Credentials live in the team password manager, never in this repo, never published |
| Writes | **Full writes.** A visitor can approve, match, generate PDFs, award an RFQ — the whole workflow |
| Cleanup | **Nightly automated reset** to a pristine seeded state, plus an on-demand reset |
| Data source | **Synthetic.** No CLFN data, scrubbed or otherwise |

### Non-goals (for v1)
- Self-serve prospect signup / lead capture — deferred until the demo has proven
  itself in live calls.
- A public "try it" link. The URL is shared deliberately, one prospect at a time.
- Any change to CLFN's live instance beyond the gated `is_demo` guardrails in §4.

## 2. Why this is also a platform test

The demo is the **first end-to-end exercise of the Phase N provisioning path**
(`docs/NATION-ONBOARDING.md` Part B + the `provision-nation` Edge Function).
Every step that turns out to be manual, undocumented, or broken while standing
up the demo is a step that would have broken on the first paying nation instead.

Concretely, it forces the one blocking N1 item that is still open: there is no
committed `supabase/bootstrap/schema.sql`, so no nation can currently be
provisioned reproducibly. That is workstream **D0** below, and it is a hard
prerequisite — not something to work around with hand-run SQL, because a
hand-built demo would drift from the real schema within weeks and stop being a
faithful preview of the product.

**Rule for the whole build:** if a step can't be done through the documented
provisioning path, fix the path rather than the demo.

---

## 3. Workstreams

### D0 — Capture the schema  *(blocking, user-run)*
- With the Supabase CLI linked to CLFN: `supabase db dump --linked -f supabase/bootstrap/schema.sql`, then commit it.
- Verify the dump is complete: tables, RLS policies, triggers, functions, sequences, and the `tenants` sync trigger.
- Adopt the standing rule already written in `supabase/bootstrap/README.md` — **regenerate the dump whenever a migration lands**, or every new nation (including the demo) starts behind. Add it to the migration checklist so it isn't remembered by luck.

**Effort:** small (one command + verification), but it gates everything else.

### D1 — Provision the demo nation
1. Create Supabase project `fnhub-demo` (via the admin panel's provisioning wizard, so the wizard gets exercised).
2. Apply `supabase/bootstrap/schema.sql` + `supabase/seed.sql` (storage bucket).
3. Deploy the Edge Functions the demo needs: `ai-chat`, `applicant-intake`, `tenant-mr`, `send-magic-link`, and `send-notification` — the last one **deliberately without working provider credentials** (see §4).
4. Add the `nations` registry row (`subdomain: 'demo'`, status `active`) on the platform project. **Do not** hardcode the demo in `NATIONS_DIRECTORY` — routing it through the registry is a live test of the registry path that CLFN's hardcoded entry can never exercise.
5. Cloudflare: confirm `demo.fnhub.app` resolves through the wildcard (no new DNS record needed) and add a Transform Rule setting `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` for `host = demo.fnhub.app`.
6. Supabase Auth → URL Configuration: Site URL `https://demo.fnhub.app`.

**Effort:** half a day, assuming D0 is clean.

### D2 — Nation identity (config only)
Everything here is configuration; the CLAUDE.md hard rule means **no literal
belongs in code** — not the demo nation's name either. A hardcoded `"Demo First
Nation"` is exactly the bug the rule exists to prevent.

- **Name:** pick a clearly fictional nation. **Verify the chosen name against the ISC First Nation Profiles registry before committing to it** — accidentally shipping marketing material branded with a real community's name, without their consent, is a serious own-goal in this market. Candidate direction: a plainly invented place-name plus "First Nation", nothing that reads as a real band or a real treaty area.
- **Set on the registry row:** `display_name`, `short`, `primary_color`, `email_domain`, `housing_email`, `modules_licensed` (turn **everything** on — the demo should show the full product).
- **Set in `housing_settings`:** `nation_config_override` (display name, contact block, mailing address, province) and the `theme` key (primary colour + logo) so generated PDFs, leases, and emails carry demo branding.
- **Logo:** a generic invented mark. Not the CLFN logo, not a real nation's.

**Effort:** small, once the name is chosen.

### D3 — Demo-mode guardrails  *(the only shipped-app code change)*
Add an `is_demo` boolean to the nation config (registry column + `nations_public`
view + `_mapNationRow` in `shared-config.js`). It is false everywhere except the
demo, so CLFN's boot is unchanged. It then drives four behaviours:

1. **Outbound email is suppressed at the single chokepoint.** `window.sendNotification` (`shared-data.js:3475`) is the one door every message goes through. In demo mode it short-circuits before the fetch, writes the audit row it would have written, and shows the composed message in the existing message box: *"Demo — email suppressed. Would have sent to X: <subject>."* This is a **better** demo than actually sending (the prospect sees the email content without waiting for an inbox), and it means the demo can never mail a real person.
2. **Defense in depth at the provider.** The demo project's `send-notification` gets **no** working provider credentials, so even a code path that bypassed the client guard cannot deliver mail. Both layers, not either.
3. **A persistent demo banner** in `renderAppHeader` (`housing-init.js:2034`): *"DEMO — fictional data. Resets nightly."* Present on every page, including the public applicant/report portals.
4. **`noindex`** — a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">` injected from `shared.js` when `is_demo`. The Cloudflare `_headers` file is path-scoped, not host-scoped, and the same static assets serve every subdomain, so a `_headers` rule or a `robots.txt` **cannot** target only the demo. The meta tag plus the D1 Transform Rule is how this actually gets done.

Also in scope: give the demo project **its own** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with a low
spend cap, so the AI assistant stays enabled (it demos extremely well) without
an unbounded bill from a crawler or a bored prospect.

**Effort:** small. Low risk — every branch is behind `is_demo`.

### D4 — The seed pack  *(the real work)*
`supabase/demo/seed-demo.sql` — deterministic, idempotent, entirely fictional,
and sized so that **no screen in the app is empty**. An empty worklist or a blank
dashboard is what kills a demo.

**Design rule: every date is relative to `now()`, never a literal.** Seed
"submitted 6 days ago", not "2026-08-10". Otherwise the demo visibly rots — the
12-month trend chart empties out, overdue inspections stop being overdue, lease
end dates drift into the past. Implement as a function using intervals so the
nightly reset in D5 re-derives fresh dates every single night.

Coverage target:

| Data | Volume | Must include |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staff | ~8 | one per role: ed, housing_manager, he_l2, he_l1, field_employee, cfo, finance_l1, super_user |
| Units | ~45 | funder + bedroom mix; occupied / vacant / reserved; a few elders units; at least one **Temporary** and one **Transition** (drives the Match Priority story); lat/long clustered on a plausible fictional location so the map widget renders |
| Tenants | ~35 | lease dates, a spread of arrears, a couple with no email on file |
| Applications | ~25 | all three `app_type`s, all statuses and tiers; drafts owned by the demo ED; one returned; several approved-awaiting-match; one transfer request so the "On Rez" badge shows |
| Maintenance requests (SOWs) | ~15 | every `approval_status`; one **System Approved** via RFQ; one assigned in-house to the field employee |
| Contractors | ~10 | mixed approval status; one with **expired WSIB** so the award eligibility warning fires |
| RFQs | 3 | one draft, one issued with bids recorded, one awarded with a contract |
| Inspections | ~8 | one failed that spawned a SOW; one overdue |
| Capital projects | 2 | a lot development and a house build — milestones, grants, expenses with attached docs, one submitted payment request |
| Finance | — | rent ledger, a loan, an arrangement, some collections activity |
| Audit log | — | enough history that Recent Activity and the audit view aren't blank |
| Other | — | tenant notes, 1–2 fictional BCR registry entries, placeholder PDFs/photos in Storage so DocLibrary isn't empty |

**Effort:** the bulk of the project — 2–3 days, and iterative. Expect to walk the
demo script (D6) and go back for more data twice.

### D5 — Nightly reset
- A `demo_reset()` SQL function in the demo project: truncate the app tables → clear the storage bucket → re-run the seed. Transactional, and it writes an audit row so you can tell a reset from a person.
- **Preserve `auth.users` and `staff`** — wiping those would invalidate the demo passwords every night. Everything else, including `housing_settings`, is re-seeded, so a prospect who fiddles with the scoring model or the approval matrix doesn't leave it changed.
- Schedule with `pg_cron` at **07:00 UTC (~3am ET)** — far from any plausible demo slot.
- **On-demand reset:** a button in the admin panel (and/or Settings, visible only when `is_demo` and role is ED) so you can re-seed between two back-to-back calls.
- **A pause flag** so a reset can't fire mid-demo if someone books an unusual hour.

**Effort:** half a day.

### D6 — Accounts, then the actual marketing asset
- Create the ~8 auth users with strong distinct passwords, stored in the team password manager. No published credentials, no one-click "sign in as ED" buttons on the login screen — those are for a future self-serve demo, not this one.
- Idle timeout stays on, unchanged.
- *Optional hardening:* Cloudflare Access in front of `demo.fnhub.app`. Note it would also gate the public applicant/report portals, so it needs path exclusions if you want to demo those.
- **`docs/DEMO-SCRIPT.md`** — a ~10-minute guided path, which is what turns this from a test environment into a marketing asset: sign in as ED → worklist → approve an application → match it to a unit → generate the occupancy agreement → raise a maintenance request → issue an RFQ → award it → a capital project claim package → the Chief & Council dashboard → ask the AI assistant a question. Plus a screenshot/video capture checklist so marketing shots stay consistent.

**Effort:** ~1 day, mostly writing and rehearsing.

## 4. Sequencing

```
D0 schema dump ─┬─> D1 provision ──> D2 identity ──> D4 seed pack ──> D6 script
                └─> D3 guardrails (parallel, independent)
                                     D5 reset (after D4)
```

D3 is the only workstream touching the shipped app and has no dependency on the
others, so it can land while the Supabase project is being stood up.

**Total: roughly a week of focused work**, dominated by D4.

---

## 5. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| **Schema drift** — demo falls behind CLFN and stops being a faithful preview | Regenerate `bootstrap/schema.sql` on every migration (D0's standing rule); re-provisioning the demo is the cheapest way to detect drift |
| **The demo emails a real person** | Two independent layers: client-side suppression at `sendNotification`, and no working provider credentials on the demo project |
| **The fictional nation name collides with a real community** | Verify against the ISC First Nation Profiles registry *before* the name reaches a logo, a URL, or a slide |
| **Google indexes the demo** | `noindex` meta from `shared.js` + a host-scoped Cloudflare Transform Rule; private credentials as the real control |
| **AI assistant cost creep** | Demo-project-specific Anthropic key with a hard spend cap |
| **A reset fires mid-demo** | 3am ET schedule + a pause flag |
| **Supabase free-tier projects pause after inactivity** | Confirm the tier before launch; nightly `pg_cron` activity may be enough, but a paused demo during a sales call is not a risk worth taking — budget for Pro |
| **Seeded data ages badly** | All dates seeded as intervals from `now()`, re-derived on every nightly reset |

## 6. Open questions

1. **Nation name and logo** — needs to be chosen and verified (D2).
2. **Public portals** (`apply.html`, `report.html`, tenant maintenance request) — live on the demo, or disabled? Live shows off the whole intake story but means anyone with the URL can post into the demo. Recommendation: live, with the banner and email suppression; the nightly reset cleans up whatever they leave.
3. **Supabase tier** for the demo project — free vs Pro (see the pausing risk above).
4. **Who else gets the credentials** beyond you — that determines whether the password manager entry is shared or personal.
